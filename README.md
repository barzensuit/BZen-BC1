# BZen-BC1

barzensuit.org is an online community of volunteers and other users, with a strong, shared purpose of of furthering awareness, education, innovation and development of full open-source solar power micro-generation solutions. 

The BZen-BC1 is proof of concept (POC), bench environment Lithium Polymer (Li-Poly) battery charger (BC).

The goal of the BZen-BC1 project is to design a functional battery charger that can be assembled and operated by a person unfamiliar with or new to DiY electronics.

The baseline requirements for the BZen-BC1 are:

* The BZen-BC1 shall charge a single cell (1S1P) Li-Poly battery which complies with UL 1642 or IEC 62133
* The BZen-BC1 shall not require soldering to connect components
* The BZen-BC1 shall be constructed of components readily available on the open market
